Dear [Name],

We were briefly in touch some time ago / I recently came across your work on [specific topic or paper], which I found very interesting.

I’m a machine learning engineer with a background in computer vision and distributed LLM training. My earlier work focused on wildlife behavior recognition using YOLOv5 and pose estimation, and more recently I’ve been working on large-scale, multi-GPU training and system optimization in decentralized settings.

I wanted to reach out to share that I’m actively continuing in ML/CV research and exploring [PhD opportunities / research collaborations / applied research roles]. If you see any potential fit, or have suggestions, I’d be very happy to hear your thoughts.

Thank you for your time, and best wishes with your research.

Kind regards,
Jorrit van Gils
