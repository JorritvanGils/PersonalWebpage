- can you show collaboration with farm technology. 

Although experience with language models, sounds completely different to computer vision. 
Key reason why two years of working on LLMs are incredibly valueable, is that many fields, including computer vision, are transitioning 
from traditional convolutional neural networks to transformer-based architectures, which have already been wieldly using in NLP.
My strong NLP background and undertanding of transformers, positions me to quickly adapt to and leverage these advances in computer vision.
