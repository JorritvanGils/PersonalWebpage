I’m excited to share that I am looking for freelance opportunities in AI and computer vision.

I hold a Master’s degree with specialization in Artificial Intelligence and have 5 years of experience building machine learning solutions. 
My career began with automated wildlife behavior classification, using YOLOv5 and pose estimation, 
and has since expanded to object detection platform BOX21 and competitions such as Fathomnet, where I developed underwater image classifiers. 
Since 2024, I’ve been contributing to Bittensor, working globally on distributed training of large language models.

My main focus is on deep learning, computer vision, NLP, and LLMs. 
I can build and deploy models using any cloud provider, and if needed, I can also develop front-end interfaces with React.

More details are on my webpage: www.jorritvangils.com
