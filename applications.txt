Subject: PhD Opportunities Inquiry

Dear [First Name],


I hope you are doing well. I was a WildDrone applicant in 2022, and since then I have been developing my skills in AI and computer vision, gaining hands-on experience with projects such as BOX21 and Bittensor. See my updated portfolio here: www.jorritvangils.com 
I am reaching out to ask if there might be any PhD opportunities in your group this year. While I am particularly interested in conservation-related applications, I am also very open to computer vision applied to other disciplines. 
Thank you very much for your time. I would be glad to have a brief chat or hear any recommendations you might have.


Best regards,  
Jorrit van Gils

Dear [Name],

We were briefly in touch some time ago / I recently came across your work on [specific topic or paper], which I found very interesting.

I’m a machine learning engineer with a background in computer vision and distributed LLM training. My earlier work focused on wildlife behavior recognition using YOLOv5 and pose estimation, and more recently I’ve been working on large-scale, multi-GPU training and system optimization in decentralized settings.

I wanted to reach out to share that I’m actively continuing in ML/CV research and exploring [PhD opportunities / research collaborations / applied research roles]. If you see any potential fit, or have suggestions, I’d be very happy to hear your thoughts.

Thank you for your time, and best wishes with your research.

Kind regards,
Jorrit van Gils
